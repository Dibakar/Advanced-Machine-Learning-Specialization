Advanced Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera

• Introduction to Deep Learning (Link to my Jupyter Notebooks):
- Developed an image-to-caption model, featuring a CNN for feature extraction (pretrained InceptionV3) from images
and a LSTM for producing captions, trained on Microsoft COCO dataset
- Built a deep convolutional autoencoder to apply to faces and similar images search
• Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning (Link to my Jupyter Notebooks):
- Implemented Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for performing soft
clustering of data
- Performed approximate Bayesian inference for logistic regression using PyMC3 (a library for probabilistic programming and inference)
- Built a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on MNIST dataset
