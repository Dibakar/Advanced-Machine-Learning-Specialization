**Advanced Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera**


**Projects/Assignments (few selected from each course):**

1. **Introduction to Deep Learning:**
   - Developed an image-to-caption model, featuring a CNN for feature extraction (pretrained InceptionV3) from images
and a LSTM for producing captions, trained on Microsoft COCO dataset
   - Built a deep convolutional autoencoder to apply to faces and similar images search

2. **Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning:**
   - Implemented Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for performing soft
clustering of data
   - Performed approximate Bayesian inference for logistic regression using PyMC3 (a library for probabilistic programming and inference)
   - Built a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on MNIST dataset
   - Designed an algorithm that uses a VAE in conjunction with Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimization to help
an user generate faces with certain properties (e.g. generate images of suspects)

3. **Practical Reinforcement Learning:**
   - Built a deep reinforcement learning agent for Atari KungFuMaster and trained it with advantage actor-critic; also
implemented a basic REINFORCE algorithm a.k.a. policy gradient for CartPole environment
   - Developed a RL agent based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) â€“ an approximate q-learning algorithm with experience
replay and target networks, and applied it to an Atari game called Breakout
   - Implemented value iteration method to solve Markov Decision Process problems, e.g. Frozen Lake environment
   
4. **Natural Language Processing:**
   - Designed a dialogue chat bot that can either answer technical programming-related questions (by replying with a
relevant answer from stack overflow), or just chit chat on all non programming-related questions. The chit-chat mode
can use either a pretrained neural converstaional model or a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model trained from
scratch on Cornell movie dialogues dataset
   - Developed a GRU-based seq2seq model (encoder-decoder architecture) to build a calculator for evaluating arithmetic
expressions
   - Trained and used word2vec and StarSpace embeddings to find duplicate questions on StackOverflow
   - Developed a LSTM-based RNN to recognize named entities on Twitter named entity recognition corpus
   
5. **Deep Learning in Computer Vision:**
   - Developed a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) for generating faces with different facial expressions
   - Developed a deep face detector for FDDB dataset
   - Developed a facial keypoint detector based on a CNN regressor
