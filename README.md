**Advanced Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera**

**Projects/Assignments (Few selected):**

1. **Introduction to Deep Learning**:
   - Developed an image-to-caption model, featuring a CNN for feature extraction (pretrained InceptionV3) from images
and a LSTM for producing captions, trained on Microsoft COCO dataset
   - Built a deep convolutional autoencoder to apply to faces and similar images search
   -

2. Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning:
  - Implemented Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for performing soft
clustering of data
  - Performed approximate Bayesian inference for logistic regression using PyMC3 (a library for probabilistic programming and inference)
  - Built a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on MNIST dataset
